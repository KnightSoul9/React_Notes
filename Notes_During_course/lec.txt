`Commands to start a vite project
npm create vite@latest
name the project then select react then select javascript
go into the project by cd 
then use Command `npm i`
to check the all downloaded files are working use Command `npm run dev`
now install the tailwind css by `install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
then`npx tailwindcss init -p`
rest read from the tailwind website in the config with the vite 
install react snippets and then while making the components just type rfce

react got its name because its reacts when any variable is updated.
React creates its own DOM and then work on it 
we use react DOM for browser and we use react native for mobile 
React creates A virtual DOM and then we pass the document into it and then we render the app we are making 
and app is just a collection of some javascript programs 
If we want to render any particular tag in the HTML document then we pass it by making react element into the root 

React contains different bundler which converts the html codes into the form of the react element (Object) because react can 
only analyze the react element codes 

React provides a special function create element which takes a certain parameters 
in the create element function we can only pass variables and the evaluated expression into it because we cannot write
the whole code inside the Object

reacts provides different hooks which helps in updating the variable in the UI 

Create Root function creats a virtual DOM and then check the main DOM to see if any changes have been made in the 
GUI and then updated the changes but the browser just repaints all the contents of the website or reload the page

whenever any website get loaded we first get the page layout {buttons and Images But it will not work} and then when we get the 
javascript then these all layout will be start working and this process when js get loaded is known as Hydration

Reconciliation is  the algorithm used by react to difference the browser tree and the virtual tree and decide which
parts should be updated this process is known as Reconciliation 

this gives power to react to just do the specific changes and not to reload the page every time the changes are made
but there are certain components that which changes every thing then in this case react will completely change and relod the 
page 

if you want to increase the performance of lists then always use the key

there is no need to update every changes immediately we can collect and and make changes in bulk this what the fibre do 
fibre basic features:-
pause work and back later to do it 
assign priority to different work
reuse previous completed work 
abort work if its no longer needed

Components: Instead of creating the traditional files on the basis of the the technology we create on the basis of the 
use we make components to reuse the code for that we write the html once and 

HOOKS
Use callback memorizes the function as much as possible

Use effect is called whenever the page is loaded and if any parameters are changed then also it reruns
use effect is also use when a components is mounted or unmounted in use effect we pass two arguments first a function 
second a dependcy array which holds the variables and any change in the variables will recall the function 

Use ref it is used to give reference to the any element in the document so that we can manipulate it 
Use Id is a react hook for generating unique id that can be passed to accessibility attributes. Do not call useID to generate keys in the lists.
Use Loader is a react hook for loading the data which is passed in it
Use Context is a hook 

React Router installation 
npm i react-router-dom
nom run dev

React Router features:
It provides link Instead of a tag because a tag reloads the page and link loads without reloading 
Outlet which helps in modification in between two different tags like updating home tag between the header and footer


Context API and Redux(React-Redux or Redux Toolkit(rtk) ) 
Context API is used to pass the value through the components and use in the inner layer where needed
Redux helps in state management and by organaizing the values passed through the components in Context api
Context is a provider and  is used to provide access to global context for this we have to wrap the components with the context
